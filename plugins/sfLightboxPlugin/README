=== Usage ===

  * 1 - To display one image

  {{{
<?php

// Test light_image
echo light_image(
    'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/thumb-1.jpg', 
    'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/image-1.jpg', 
    array()
);

$image_options = array('title' => 'Optional caption.');    
echo light_image(
    'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/thumb-2.jpg', 
    'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/image-2.jpg', 
    $image_options
);
?>
  }}}

  * 2 - To display a slide show of several images
  
  {{{
<?php

// To display a slide show of several images
$images[] = array(
    'thumbnail' => 'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/thumb-3.jpg',
    'image'     => 'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/image-3.jpg',
    'options'   => array('title' => 'Roll over and click right side of image to move forward.')
);

$images[] = array(
    'thumbnail' => 'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/thumb-4.jpg',
    'image'     => 'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/image-4.jpg',
    'options'   => array('title' => 'Alternatively you can press the right arrow key.')
);

$images[] = array(
    'thumbnail' => 'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/thumb-5.jpg',
    'image'     => 'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/image-5.jpg',
    'options'   => array('title' => 'The script preloads the next image in the set as you\'re viewing.')
);

$images[] = array(
    'thumbnail' => 'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/thumb-6.jpg',
    'image'     => 'http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/images/image-6.jpg',
    'options'   => array('title' => 'Press Esc to close')
);

$link_options = array(
    'title'     => 'Lightbox2',
    'slidename' => 'lightbox',
);    


echo light_slideshow($images, $link_options);

?>
  }}}
  
  * 3 - To display a modal box with the content of the result of a symfony action
  
  {{{
<?php 

// Modal Lightbox plugin test
$link_options = array(
    'title' => 'sfLightboxPlugin',
    'size'  => '450x180',
    'speed' => '5'
);    

// or
//$link_options='title=sfLightboxPlugin size=450x180 speed=5';
//$link_options='title="sfLightboxPlugin" class=resizespeed_5 blocksize_450x180';
 
echo light_modallink('<h3>&raquo; Link to test the modal box &laquo;</h3>', 'sfLightboxPlugin/modal', $link_options);
  
?>
  }}}  

  Of course here i use external images, but you can put path related to your '''images''' directory as you would do with the imag_tag function.

  You can change the class or options to adjust the wanted size or speed. Of course you can use a route instead of a 'module/action'. The demo above does exactly the same as [http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/ the official homepage of the Lightbox2 library], moreover the plugin includes this demo as a module, just enable the '''sfLightboxPlugin''' module in your settings.yml file then call the demo in your application http://www.domain.com/sfLightboxPlugin.

  * That's all, ;)

=== Versions ===

== 1.0.5 ==
  * Added a demo as a symfony module that does the excalty the same as the official demo page of the library
  * Change options handling for light_modallink to allow 3 different syntaxes

== 1.0.4 ==
  * `LightboxHelper.php` :
    When creating a slideshow the caption of the images are now taken from the title attribute of each images if it exists whereas it is taken from the title attribute of the link if not (before it was always taken from the title link attribute)

== 1.0.3 ==
  * modalbox.js 
    now allows to call initModalbox several times (in case a modal link is created dynamically, after page load). Don't forget to call initModalbox() again when you create a new modal link.
  * config.php :
    corrected wrong paths stored in config

== 1.0.2 ==
  * Helpers enhancements
    options are now parsed so they can be scalar or array, just like the link_to helper 
    light_modallink : added 'speed' and 'size' options (using regular classes is still allowed to keep BC)
  * modalbox.js fixes :
      removed some unused, unitialized variables that could cause JS errors in IE6 in some cases.
  * File structure changes :
      Removed the 'lightbox' folder in web/css, web/js and web/images
      Prepared for next release in web/images, as closelabel.gif will be culture-dependent

== 1.0.1 ==
  * Some bug fixes in modalbox.js and also modalbox.css which affected IE6/7 and Opera.
  * Renaiming of some html identifiers in modalbox to allow use of modalbox and lightbox in the same document. (more info in modalbox.js file)
  * Modified default close image from 'closelabel.gif' which was culture dependent to 'close.gif' (only a close cross).

== 1.0.0 ==
  * First version
